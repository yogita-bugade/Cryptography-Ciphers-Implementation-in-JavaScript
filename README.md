<h1>Cryptography Ciphers Implementation in JavaScript</h1>

<b>This project focuses on designing and implementing the functionality of multiple cryptography ciphers while maintaining uniformity in the utilized functions. The primary goal is to implement essential functionality for various ciphers in JavaScript. Users can input their plaintext messages and keys to generate ciphertext or provide ciphertext and keys to obtain plaintext. The project emphasizes creating a simple yet aesthetically pleasing user interface to provide a practical approach to understanding and utilizing ciphers. The interface includes information about encryption, along with directions and examples of keys (keyword, n X n key square, period, number of rails, etc.).

<h2>Description</h2>
Implementation of Classical Ciphers - This project showcases the implementation of six classical ciphers, each demonstrating unique encryption techniques. The main page provides information about these ciphers, and dedicated web pages detail the implementation of each one:
</p>

<b>1. Caesar Cipher:</b> <br />
- The Caesar cipher, one of the simplest and oldest known ciphers, operates as a substitution cipher. It involves shifting each letter in the plaintext down the alphabet by a fixed number of positions.

<b>2. Morse Code Cipher:</b> <br />
- Morse Code uses short and long pulses (audio, visual, electrical, etc.) to encode messages. This cipher represents each letter and number with a unique combination of dots and dashes.

<b>3. Running Key Cipher:</b> <br />
- Similar to the Vigenere cipher, the Running Key cipher employs substitution. The key selection distinguishes it, utilizing a long key (e.g., a book excerpt) instead of a repeating short key.

<b>4. ASCII Cipher:</b> <br />
- The ASCII cipher is a substitution cipher using the ASCII computer code. It replaces each letter with its corresponding ASCII value. For example, 'a' is replaced with 97, 'b' with 98, and so on.

<b>5. Atbash Cipher:</b> <br />
- The Atbash cipher, also known as the mirror or reverse alphabet cipher, is a monoalphabetic substitution cipher. It originated from the Hebrew alphabet, where each letter is replaced with its mirror image.

<b>6. Vernam Cipher:</b> <br />
- The Vernam Cipher, also called the One Time Pad algorithm, encrypts alphabetic plain text through transposition techniques. It assigns a unique number to each character in the plain text.
